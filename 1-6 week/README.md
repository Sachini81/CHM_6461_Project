# Lattice Polymer Monte Carlo (Weeks 1–6) — SAW + HP Model (2D)

This project implements a **2D lattice polymer** model using:
- **SAW (Self-Avoiding Walk)** geometry
- **Monte Carlo (Metropolis) sampling**
- **HP model** energy (H–H non-bonded nearest-neighbor contacts)

The code is organized by “weeks” (Week 1 → Week 6).

## Files
- `weeks1_6.py`  
  Main script containing Weeks 1–6 code. Running it prints results and saves output to a text file.
- `weeks1_6_output.txt`  
  Auto-generated output file created after running the script (saved in the same directory).

## Requirements
- Python **Python 3.14.3**
