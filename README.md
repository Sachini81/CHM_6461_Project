# 2D Lattice Polymer (Week 1)

It stores polymer bead coordinates on a 2D grid and checks if the chain is:
- **Self-avoiding** (no two beads occupy the same lattice site)
- **Connected** (each consecutive bead is a nearest neighbor)

## Files
- `lattice_representation.py`  
  Contains:
  - `Lattice2D`: keeps track of occupied lattice points
  - `Polymer2D` : stores polymer coordinates + bonds and validates the chain
  - `straight_chain(n)`: generates an initial straight chain in 2D
